# Open TUN device file, create tap0
#
#  To open a new transient device, put "tap%d" into ioctl() below.
#   To open a persistent device, use "tap0" or the actual full name.
#
#  You can create a persistent device with "openvpn --mktun --dev tap0".
#   This device will show up on ifconfig, but will have "no link" unless  
#   it is opened by this or similar script even if you bring it up with
#   "ifconfig tap0 up". This can be confusing.
#
#  Copied from https://gist.github.com/glacjay/585369 
#   IFF_NO_PI is important! Otherwise, tap will add 4 extra bytes per packet, 
#     and this will confuse Scapy parsing.

# -----------------------[ MacOS X:]-------------------------
#
#  For Mac OS X, there is no /dev/net/tun to do ioctls on. Instead, 
#     you need to load tap.kext to create /dev/tap0 ... /dev/tapN and
#     then open /dev/tap0 directly. 
#
#  For pre-Yosemite (10.10) OS X:
#     A usable binary version of tap.kext comes with TunnelBlick.
#     Since in a typical configuration TunnelBlick only uses /dev/tunX not tap0,
#     it seems that you can load tap.kext without interfering with openvpn.
#
#  These used to work, depending on the version:
# subprocess.check_call("kextload /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/tap.kext", shell=True)
# subprocess.check_call("kextload /opt/local/Library/Extensions/tap.kext", shell=True)
#
#     Alternatively MacPorts has a package tuntaposx ("port install tuntaposx").
#     Note: you can only have one version loaded at a time! kextunload if needed,
#           check with kextstat. 
#
#     Cisco's Anyconnect VPN client would also interfere, see http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/faq.xhtml
#     for commands to stop it and load/unload kernel drivers.
#
#  For OS X Yosemite and later(?), loading of unsigned kernel modules is inhibited
#   by default. The above kextload command will fail. 
#   As of 10.10, there are two ways to proceed: 
#     (1) turn off module signing    -- see howto-disable-kext-signing.txt 
#     (2) used signed module version -- see howto-load-signed-tunnelblick-drivers.txt
#
#   (2) in a nutshell: download and install Tunnelblick, then
#   # kextutil -d /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/tap-signed.kext -b net.tunnelblick.tap

def open_tap_macos(ifname):

    # check if /dev/tap? exists. If not, try to load the tap/tun driver.
    if not os.path.exists(ifname):
        print "ERROR: /dev/%s does not appear to exist. Check that the tun/tap kext is loaded." % ifname
        print "See comments in pytap.py for how to load a tun/tap kext on 10.10 & higher.\n"

    tun = os.open("/dev/%s" % ifname, os.O_RDWR)
    # Seems like the right IFF_NO_PI setting is default on Mac, no need for ioctl.
